Very soon would be New Year and Christmas Eve. So I want to
show you a couple images I had paint not a very long time ago.
I'm not a very good artist, so do not laugh :).

Summer was great this year and I think on next one, 
it would be even better.

This is tree of life. Overflowing with energy.

I'm not a very good at painting, as you can see, but
I hope on next year my paints would be better.

I wish you have a good time on this holidays :).
