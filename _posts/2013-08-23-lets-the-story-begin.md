Date: 2013-08-23 15:30

A couple days ago rastacoding was closed. So I should find a way to countinue blogging in same way. So lets try this things here.

**Kodingen** was good place to host such site, but like any others this project is mortal. But unlike many others it was reborn like a phoenix from the ashes in **Koding**.

[Koding](//koding.com "Koding") is IDE with real linux console working in web browser. Right there all working process on [Cloud Commander](//cloudcmd.io/ "Cloud Commander") is going on there.

From [v0.3.0](http://github.com/coderaiser/cloudcmd/releases/tag/v0.3.0 "Cloud Commander v0.3.0") Commander is writing substantially in it self.
