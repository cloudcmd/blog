Title: How to write an article on wiki?
Date: 2013-10-09 14:55 

So I tried to write an article about [Cloud Commander](http://cloudcmd.io "Cloud Commander") in [Wiki](http://wikipedia.org "Wiki"). But it's harder then I thought. A couple minutes after creating it was marked  as recommended for deletion. Well... OK, this was with me earlier but this message appears for a month and then it disappeared in some moment. 

But this time everything was in another way. My topic was removed on a next day. And that's all.

I was very angry for a first time. But later when I tried to understand why them do this. I have understood some very important things about writing articles on Wiki. So I want to share it with you:

- in article should be links and information from third parties;
- article should not copy information from owners site, it should be something different;
- should be good and bad sides, not just promotion.
- thing which is writing by you should be popular in some way.

I hope it will help somebody to save his time and do things in a right way so nobody would not feel hurt.
