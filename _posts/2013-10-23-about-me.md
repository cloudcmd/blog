So, I'm 25. And you can call me [Coderaiser](http://coderaiser.github.io "Coderaiser"). I'm active Open Source contributor and maintainer of such projects as **Cloud Commander**, **Minify** and **Nemizida**.
This projects not ashamed to show.

[Nemizida](http://coderaiser.github.io/nemizida "Nemizida") was written by me a couple yers ago, 7 I think, on x86 Assembly. It's basic operation system. You could play with it on site.

[Minify](http://coderaiser.github.io/minify "Minify") was written as module for Cloud Commander. It's combine of js-css-img minifiers which is make life simpler and more funny.

 [Cloud Commander](http://cloudcmd.io "Cloud Commander") it's project I'm working on 1,5 year. It's written totally on **JavaScript** and **Node.js**. It's file manager of new generation. He cross platform, works on cloud and help to make magic things.

Why am I doing such things? I just like programming and make new products. When I was kid a had played enough in 8-bit games, than in computer games. But I always want to make new things and make the world a little bit batter.

Besides programming I like music, write songs, poetry, ping-pong and outdoor recreation. Thing I like the most is performing own songs on stage. Recently I start playing on Jambe. And by the way this is my cat on a picture :).
