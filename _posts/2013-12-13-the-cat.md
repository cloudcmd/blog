![TheCat](http://cat.cloudcmd.io/cat.png "The Cat")

A little bit fun for today's friday.
Not so long time ago i wrote litle [cat server](http://coderaiser.github.io/thecat "The Cat").
It's easy-to-use service with one task to do. It serve cats. New cat on every request.

You could add the cat to your site. It's as easy as to type a couple commands.
If you use Markdown, this can help.

```
![The cat](http://cat.cloudcmd.io/cat.png)
```

Html version downside.
```
<img alt="The Cat" src=http://cat.cloudcmd.io/cat.png />
```

The reason why I made this, just for fun at first. And for second if you have to
generate some data on any reason you could show people thing almost everybody loves :).

This could not be done whitout [this](http://iconka.com "Iconka") man, who paint cats :).
If you interested how it's works from the inside look github repo.
Pull requests are wellcome. Spread the cat :).
